## Maya Camera Lattice

Our Camera Lattice tool is the ultimate solution for mesh deformations in camera space. Attach a lattice to your camera and deform any mesh in a matter of seconds!

### Features:

* Lattice deformation in camera space
* Multiple lattices per camera
* Easily affects multiple meshes with a single camera lattice
* Bezier and linear interpolations
* Recursion parameter for bezier deformation
* Deform meshes with multiple camera lattices
* Utilities for accurate control on lattice points
* Gate Offset attribute to prevent weird deformations on lattice edges
* Influence Areas locators to localise deformation in 3D space

If you are planning to use one of our tools in a studio, we would be grateful if you could let us know.

### Known limitations:

* Few free maya rigs you find on the internet may not work with this tool
* The camera lattice is a poly plane; you cannot select objects beyond it in object selection mode when looking through camera panel.
* You can only have one camera lattice per camera.

### Maya Bugs
* Viewport 2.0 does not display the lattice correctly when the camera near clip plane is different from the default value. Please use the “Legacy Default Viewport” when using this tool.
* Manipulators may not be displayed correctly in camera view
